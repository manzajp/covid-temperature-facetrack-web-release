                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    In the current pandemic situation, 
                    all countries are fighting COVID-19 and are 
                    still looking for a practical and cost-effective 
                    solution to the problems that are arising in a variety of ways.
                    Researchers in physical sciences and engineering are attempting to meet 
                    such challenges by developing new theories, describing new research problems, 
                    developing user-centered explanations, and educating ourselves and the public.
                    The purpose of this brief review was to raise awareness of this innovative technology 
                    and its significant applications for the COVID-19 pandemic. That is when the IOT 
                    and real time processing comes handy to handle the situation. Real-time systems 
                    are now used in a wide range of applications, including avionics, automotive, 
                    and patient monitoring, to name a few. A Real-time System (RTS) is limited in 
                    its ability to carry out its functionality due to (strict) timing constraints. 
                    In this SDD the proposed system will provide a solution to detect probable COVID-19 
                    patients around using IOT in real time.
